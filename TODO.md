# Ideas and stuff

- Add login, allow to connect to remote host, what ui ?
- Fix navbar when lots of tables, make responsive etc
- I hate __tostring, its hacky
- Improve error pages, eg use layout
- Config to remove CRUD rights
- Add checkbox (rounded) in listing to allow multiple delete/edit
- Understand `modified_at`/`created_at` kind of fields for getLastModified
- Add a 's' shortcut that focus to search box
- CSS print media type
- // elseif name match: password, month, week, email, url, tel, color
- Support for SET, BINARY and other datatypes
- Add .xlsx download link (default limit to a high value)
- Inject Config object instead of using a global variable
- Add link with min/max aggregates, also why no aggregates on dates too ?
- Add http basic auth, integrates with the MySQL connection
- Use LocalStorage to save state, eg. edited fields, current sorts and search etc.
- Would it be possible custom auth based on relations, eg. must have fk down to loggedin user ?
